# Youtube Music Downloader

This is a basic project which downloads music from youtube, it was developed using pytube and tkinter for a basic gui.

The way the program works is by adding urls to a list or a url playlist, then when you wish to download the script will simply iterate through the list dowloading each url, also, this is run on a different thread to the gui which makes it so the it still works while downloading.
