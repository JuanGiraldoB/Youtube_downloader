# Youtube Music Downloader

This is a basic project which downloads music from youtube, it was developed using pytube and tkinter for a basic gui.

The way the program works is by adding urls to a list, then when you wish to download the script will simply iterate through the list dowloading each url, also, this is run on a different thread to the gui which makes it so the gui still works while downloading

## To do:
*   Download playlists
*   Choose between video or audio
*   Choose video/audio quality
